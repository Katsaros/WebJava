# WebJava Framework
WebJava is a lightweight, modular Java web framework built from scratch, providing an intuitive and flexible development experience. It empowers developers to create robust web applications with ease, offering a range of features commonly found in modern web frameworks.

## Key Features
-   **Modularity:**  WebJava adopts a modular design, allowing developers to use only the components they need. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
-   **Dependency Injection:**  The framework includes a powerful dependency injection system, enabling seamless management of class dependencies. The  `@AutoInitialize`  annotation simplifies the initialization and injection of classes.
-   **Routing and Endpoints:**  WebJava provides a straightforward routing mechanism using custom annotations like  `@Endpoint`,  `@Get`,  `@Post`,  `@Put`, and  `@Delete`. This makes defining RESTful endpoints intuitive and concise.
-   **Storage Managers:**  WebJava provides specific ready-to-use methods to execute operations to databases easily.
